# mnist_neural_network
We will be using Google Colab to write Tensorflow 2 Code, Google Colab is essentially a Jupyter Notebook, with all the python libraries pre-installed, it let the user write and execute python code right in the browser and hence making the getting started phase quicker.
The best part of this is it comes with the GPU/CPU/TPU environment that a user can select, all the required packages are pre-installed. GPUs are excellent in using repeated tasks on varieties of data which is very much required during training as they mostly include matrix multiplication over huge set of data.
In this tutorial, we will write a Neural Network to identify the handwritten digit and then train it using the MNIST dataset.
